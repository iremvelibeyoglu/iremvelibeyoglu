- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Irem (@iremvelibeyoglu)!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science & analytics, data engineering, and machine learning. I hold a PhD in Civil Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, where I applied data science techniques to smart structures. Then, I worked as a data scientist at multiple companies of different sizes (start up to big corporates) in different industries including healthcare and tech.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data engineering principles to widen my technical skillset.
